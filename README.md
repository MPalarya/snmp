# snmp
Trying out basic snmp functionallities

This is an example of simple set/get commands over SNMPv3 with authentication.
The code was simulated with SNMP Agent Simulator (by iReasoning, although snmplabs has one as well) and tested with working hardware

For SNMPv2, just replace the user authentication data with CommunityData(community) as described in pysnmp's documentations
